## Getting Started

### For Solo Development

1. **Add custom-instructions.md to Claude Project**

   - Copy content to Claude Project settings
   - This ensures core context in every conversation

2. **Reference specific docs as needed**

   - Claude will automatically search these when relevant
   - You can explicitly mention: "Check authentication.md for Cognito setup"

3. **Keep docs updated**
   - Update when architecture changes
   - Document new patterns and decisions

### For Onboarding New Developers

1. **Start with README** (this file)
2. **Read custom-instructions.md** - High-level overview
3. **Review architecture.md** - System design
4. **Study authentication.md** - Multi-tenant patterns
5. **Understand database-schema.md** - RLS and data model
6. **Deep dive into core feature docs** as needed

## Quick Reference

### Common Scenarios

**"How do I add a new API endpoint?"**

1. Check `coding-standards.md` for patterns
2. Review `authentication.md` for JWT validation
3. See `database-schema.md` for RLS context

**"How do I deploy to staging?"**

1. Follow `deployment.md` staging workflow
2. Check `monitoring.md` for post-deployment validation

**"I need to add a new assessment question type"**

1. Review `assessment-engine.md` question schema
2. Update Zod schemas per `coding-standards.md`
3. Test with `database-schema.md` RLS patterns

**"Users report slow video loading"**

1. Check `video-management.md` for optimization tips
2. Review `monitoring.md` for CloudFront metrics
3. Consider `future-considerations.md` for transcoding

**"Security audit is coming up"**

1. Review `security.md` OWASP checklist
2. Verify `authentication.md` JWT practices
3. Check `database-schema.md` RLS policies

## Phase 1 MVP Focus

The project is currently in **Phase 1 MVP** with these priorities:

### ‚úÖ Core Features (Building Now)

- Cognito authentication (individual + business)
- Dynamic assessment engine
- Program generation
- Video library (single quality)
- Progress tracking
- Multi-tenant data isolation (RLS)

### ‚ùå Deferred to Phase 2+ (See future-considerations.md)

- Multi-AZ database
- Video transcoding
- Advanced monitoring (X-Ray, APM)
- MFA / SSO
- White-label customization
- Mobile apps

### üéØ Success Criteria

- Ship MVP in 6 - 8 months (solo build!)
- Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- Zero tenant data leakage incidents
- 10-50 beta users successfully using platform

## Key Principles

1. **Speed Over Perfection** - Ship fast, iterate on feedback
2. **Solid Foundation** - Establish patterns even if simple
3. **Security First** - Healthcare app = higher security bar
4. **Multi-Tenant Always** - Never skip tenant context validation

## Tech Stack Summary

- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript + TailwindCSS + Amplify
- **Backend**: Node.js + TypeScript + Lambda + API Gateway
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (RDS) with Row-Level Security
- **Auth**: AWS Cognito with custom attributes
- **Infrastructure**: SST (Serverless Stack)
- **Storage**: S3 + CloudFront CDN
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch
- **Validation**: Zod schemas everywhere

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Local development with hot-reload
npm run sst dev

# Run tests
npm run test
npm run test:e2e

# Deploy to environment
npm run sst deploy --stage dev

# View logs
npm run sst logs --stage dev --function assessments
```

## Cost Estimates (Phase 1)

| Service                   | Monthly Cost     |
| ------------------------- | ---------------- |
| Cognito                   | $0 (Free tier)   |
| RDS (t3.small, Single AZ) | ~$30             |
| S3 + CloudFront           | $5-20            |
| Lambda                    | $0-5 (Free tier) |
| API Gateway               | $0-5 (Free tier) |
| Amplify                   | $0 (Free tier)   |
| CloudWatch                | $0-5             |
| Route53                   | $1               |
| **Total**                 | **$36-66/month** |

## Critical Reminders

### Non-Negotiables (Even Phase 1)

- ‚úÖ Multi-tenant data isolation (RLS)
- ‚úÖ Secure authentication (Cognito)
- ‚úÖ Input validation (Zod)
- ‚úÖ Encrypted data at rest and in transit
- ‚úÖ Audit logging (CloudWatch)
- ‚úÖ No sensitive data in logs

### Acceptable Trade-offs (Phase 1)

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Single AZ database (can upgrade later)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic monitoring (can add X-Ray later)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Single video quality (can add transcoding later)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è 30% test coverage (increase over time)

## Documentation Maintenance

### When to Update

**After Infrastructure Changes:**

- Update `architecture.md` with new services
- Update `deployment.md` with new workflows

**After Security Changes:**

- Update `security.md` with new policies
- Update `authentication.md` if auth flow changes

**After Adding Features:**

- Update relevant domain doc (assessment, video, etc.)
- Update `coding-standards.md` if new patterns emerge

**When Deferring Features:**

- Add to `future-considerations.md` with rationale

### Version Control

- All documentation lives in Git
- Update docs in same PR as code changes
- Tag docs with version releases

## Getting Help

### Internal Resources

- This documentation directory
- Code comments in critical sections
- Test files for examples

### External Resources

- **SST Docs**: https://sst.dev/
- **AWS Docs**: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/
- **TypeScript**: https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/
- **Zod**: https://zod.dev/
- **React**: https://react.dev/

### When Stuck

1. Check relevant documentation file first
2. Review CloudWatch logs with tenant/user context
3. Test in isolation (unit test the specific function)
4. Ask Claude (with context from these docs)
5. Check AWS service limits and quotas
